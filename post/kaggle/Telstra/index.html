<h2 id="1-overview:43e8ca42a888262ca3ed3923385c58f2"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h2>

<p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/telstra-recruiting-network/">problem</a> is to predict Telstr network&rsquo;s fault severity at a time at a particular location based on the <em>log data</em> available.</p>

<p>The target has 3 categories:0,1,2. It&rsquo;s a multiclass classification problems.Different types of features are extracted from log files and other sources: event_type.csv, log_feature.csv, resource_type.csv,severity_type.csv.</p>

<p>My final score is <em>0.44917(72 of 974)</em> in private leaderboard. Here are my <a href="https://github.com/Cherishzhang/kaggle/tree/master/Telstra">code</a>, and I will record my solution.</p>

<h2 id="2-feature-engineer:43e8ca42a888262ca3ed3923385c58f2"><strong>2. Feature Engineer</strong></h2>

<p>Selecting and designing good features is an important area in machine learning, which is called <em>feature engineering</em>.</p>

<p>At First, I just merge all files on Id. Here are five type of features. they are location, severity_type, resource_type, event_type, log_feature.
location and severity_type are just one-to-one variables, and others are many_to_one variables.
There are about 1200 locations, some are only in the test set. The correlation between location variable and target is 0.27, it gave me a hint that neighbouring locations may be similar in the network&rsquo;s fault severity problem. I used one_hot encode to solve the many_to_one features. So there are about 400+ features in the initial stage.</p>

<p>I read a paper about how to preprocess high-cardinality Categorical attributes in classification and regression problems, but it seemed to bring little help. I will tried it again after the competition.</p>

<p>On the forum, there are a heated discussion about the magic feature. I spent much of my time to find it.
It is the order of the same location in the severity file which follows the order of fault occurrence.It&rsquo;s called <em>Intra-location order</em>.<br />
It really did a big help to the final score which improved almost 0.06. To each record, I compute the target(<em>fault_severity</em>) probabilities from the previous same location records, and used the <em>previous-target_probabilities</em> as a feature to build the model.</p>

<h2 id="3-build-models-and-ensembling:43e8ca42a888262ca3ed3923385c58f2"><strong>3. Build models and Ensembling</strong></h2>

<p>I tried many models, decision tree, random forests, svm and xgboost. The xgboost model is performed well.
On ensembling, I just average the random forest and xgboost result as the final result.</p>

<p>On the platform, kagglers are willing to share their ideas. Here are some valuable ideas on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/telstra-recruiting-network/forums/t/19239/it-s-been-fun-post-your-code-github-links-here-after-the-competition">Competition Forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="some-useful-tips-on-feature-engineering:43e8ca42a888262ca3ed3923385c58f2">Some useful tips on feature engineering</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s the most important step in machine learning whatever models you used.</p>

<ol>
<li>About location<br />
<em>Similar location numbers have similar fault severity.(Treat the location as numeric.)</em>
<em>Don&rsquo;t one-hot-encode the location, Tree-based classifiers are not good at handling huge sparse feature matrix.</em>
<em>Frequency of LogType_203 = 0 &amp; LogType_203 &gt;0 per location</em>
<em>The records in log data are arranged in the order of time.(the magic feature)</em> Here are two ways to encode
the information, One is for each location, use the row number, which starts from 1 to the total number of rows for that locaiton. The other
is to normalize it between 0 and 1.
<em>percentile transformation of location counts</em></li>
<li>About log feature<br />
<em>Pattern of log feature</em>
&ldquo;one hot&rdquo; encoding for all log features with volume &gt; 0, for all rows.
Each &ldquo;one hot&rdquo; encoded pattern treated as a string.
Assigned integer ID to each to each string, used as feature.
The log transform for the count of &ldquo;pattern of log feature&rdquo;, the log transform for counts as &ldquo;pattern of event&rdquo;
and &ldquo;pattern of resource&rdquo;</li>
<li>Common categorical variables<br />
<em>For high-cardinality categorical variables, frequency works well.(Add the frequency of each location in both train and test set.)</em>
<em>Summary statistics to reduce one-to-many relationship to one-to-one, and two-way or more-way interaction among multiple variables.</em>
<em>Meta features(using Logistic regression to fit sparse matrix as predictors, then ensemble the model).</em></li>
<li>A useful solution<br />
&gt;a.The order of id on log_feature was frozen.<br />
&gt;b.Converting location, log_feature into numbers and generating count, mean, sum, etc. features (feature set A)<br />
&gt;c.Feature B was generated by shifting A forward by 1 row<br />
&gt;d.Feature C was generated by shifting B backward by 1 row<br />
&gt;Combining A, B, and C and training xgb, RF, GBM models. My final model is an ensemble model of these models.<br /></li>
